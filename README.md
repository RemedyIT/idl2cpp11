# IDL to C++11 example code

This project demonstrates the IDL to C++11 language mapping which is implemented
by [Remedy IT](http://www.remedy.nl) as part of the [TAOX11](https://taox11.remedy.nl) and
[AXCIOMA](https://www.axcioma.com) products.

Interested to see the C++11 generated code for some IDL constructs that are not
part of this project? Create a pull request with your IDL construct added to
one of the existing IDL files or create a new IDL file! We will add the generated C++ headers
that match your IDL!

When you want to try it yourself go to the [TAOX11 website](https://taox11.remedy.nl/software/overview.html)
and request your own free-of-charge evaluation license.
