# IDL to C++11 example code

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2f85094e9158443491b51127c1c6eea3)](https://www.codacy.com/app/RemedyIT/idl2cpp11?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=RemedyIT/idl2cpp11&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This project demonstrates the IDL to C++11 language mapping which is implemented
by [Remedy IT](http://www.remedy.nl) as part of the [TAOX11](https://taox11.remedy.nl) and
[AXCIOMA](https://www.axcioma.com) products.

Interested to see the C++11 generated code for some IDL constructs that are not
part of this project? Create a pull request with your IDL construct added to
one of the existing IDL files or create a new IDL file! We will add the generated C++ headers
that match your IDL!

When you want to try it yourself go to the [TAOX11 website](https://taox11.remedy.nl/software/overview.html)
and request your own free-of-charge evaluation license.
